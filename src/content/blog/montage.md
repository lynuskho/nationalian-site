Dynamic Filipinism is a philosophy that guides the education of Filipino students to become responsible citizens who contribute to the global progress, kinship, and universal culture. As students of BS Computer Engineering, we particularly aim to develop the aspects of innovation and dynamicism. Although we are still freshmen, we believe we have already applied Dynamic Filipinism in our course in multiple ways, and it is our hope that we remain guided by this principle as we study college and even further in our future careers. 

# Building a website

In this very course, building a website was a key requirement, and the deadline set did not give our group an abundance of time to figure out how to build a whole website. We did not want to use a website builder because we thought the elements on the page weren't customizable enough. Therefore, we opted to build a website from scratch, then hosting it on a server. Although this challenge was daunting logistically, we were able to research the most efficient ways of building a custom site and in the end, style it such that it even was themed in the colors of NU, and had little details such as colored links, an underline marking which page of the site one is in, etc. 

**Principle: Innovation**

# Tutoring

Because us freshmen come from a variety of backgrounds, some of us have advanced knowledge of topics in schools while others lag behind. However, we can see Dynamic Filipinism embodied in this class when students help other students and even hold tutorial sessions free of charge. If this is indicative of anything, it's that the students of BS Computer Engineering have compassion for their peers, and use the power of education to make sure that everyone steps on equal footing in college.

**Principle: Compassion, Education**

# Debugging in Programming Class

A memorable display of Dynamic Filipinism came at an unexpected time: Programming class. The teacher had just left the classroom for a while and tasked us to complete a program he was discussing in the lesson prior. However, it turned out that all of our programs were not working, having some sort of compiler error which left us unable to test our programs. Instead of passively waiting for our professor, the class managed to trace back the error and go into the program settings to tweak it such that the program worked at last. They developed a whole step-by-step process just so that everyone in the class had the opportunity to program, and the professor even commended the class, saying he was not even familiar with the solution they came up with. This is a prime example of the dynamicism that is an examplar of Dynamic Filipinism: when the class faced an unexpected challenge, they were able to adapt on the fly, using quick wits to come up with a solution that had not been taught yet. 

**Principle: Dynamicism**
