# Jhocson Monument
The National University unveiled the Don Mariano F. Jhocson statue on October 15, 2021 to commemorate the founder’s 144th birthday and 121st foundation anniversary of the National University. The university’s founder monument is located right in front of the Jhocson Memorial Building. The first statue was gone after the original Main Building, the Law and Commerce Building, the Elementary Building, and the Graduate School Building were all destroyed by fire on January 1, 1998. After three weeks of repair work, the university was able to reopen its doors and use the Mariano F. Jhocson Memorial Building. The College of Dentistry Building, constructed in the 1920s, was the only structure on the NU campus to escape the fire unscathed. The statue was first created after the death of Don Mariano in 1928.
